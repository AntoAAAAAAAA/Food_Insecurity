### Key Takeaways:
- Urban areas contain the greatest number of food desert tracts, especially in population hubs like Harris, Dallas, San Antonio, and El Paso.
- Approximately **20% of all Texas census tracts** qualify as food deserts.
- Nearly **one in four Texans** experiences some level of food insecurity.
- **Child food insecurity** is most pronounced in large urban counties.
- There was **no consistent correlation** between minority population percentage and county-level food insecurity.
- **Loving, Kenedy, and Kent counties** stood out for having high food insecurity despite large portions of their population being above SNAP income eligibility thresholds.
- A **SNAP coverage gap** was calculated to quantify the number of eligible individuals not receiving benefits.
- A final **composite food insecurity score** was developed to identify counties in greatest need of intervention. The top priority counties include:  
  **Harris, Dallas, Presidio, Hidalgo, Bexar, Cottle, El Paso, Starr, Tarrant, and Hall.**

### Policy Implications:
- Expand SNAP outreach and enrollment assistance in counties with large SNAP coverage gaps.
- Invest in affordable grocery access within **LILA (Low-Income, Low-Access)** tracts.
- Launch targeted public health interventions in counties with **high cost per meal** and limited access.
- Prioritize urban counties that combine **high population**, **high FI rates**, and **low SNAP coverage** for intervention and funding.
- **Targeted interventions in outlier counties** like Loving, Kent, and Kenedy that fall outside traditional SNAP support zones
- **Incentivize grocery store development** (via tax breaks or grants) in underserved areas
